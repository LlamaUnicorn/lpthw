    Install pytest from Terminal - pip install -U pytest
    Change your test file names from *_tests.py to *_test.py
    Replace the import at the beginning of the test from nose to pytest with an import pytest
    Replace your assert_equal() statements to assert ’ == ’ NOTE: Drop the brackets
    E.g. assert_equal(center.go('north') , north) turns into assert center.go('north') == north
    Run your tests from the project directory (one level above the test folder) using the command ‘$pytest’ instead of the command ‘$nosetests’
